1. Auto document Rest API + Hook to do this for all plugins
3. Auto configure port / server name / whathaveyou
4. RemoteMouse should be able to two finger scroll up and down...

2. Independant view / public management per plugin. Maybe we also add the ability to specify other folders other than public and view whilst
still using the PluginInterface?

5. Plugins can be installed as self contained packages using npm - this is cool since it can come w/ its own public / views folders.
